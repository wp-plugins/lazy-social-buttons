Delayed loading of Google +1, Twitter and Facebook social buttons on your posts. Have your cake and eat it too; social buttons and performance.

== Description ==

Social buttons attract more visitors to your site. When users +1, Tweet, or
Like your page, it advertises your  page to their friends and followers. This
plugin adds social buttons to your posts as a small sprite at first and delays
loading the real buttons until the user hovers over the social buttons.  It
delays ~300KB of social button components by loading <6.5KB of our own script
and sprite. onMouseOver activates the load of the ~300KB of social button
components.

Our current version is limited to +1, Tweet, and Like and has the horizontal
display with the spinning wait indicator.
